# Task 06: Migration System

## Status: ✅ Completed

## Overview
Generate database migration system with version control, rollback capabilities, and automated schema management.

## Current State
- Basic GORM auto-migration
- No migration versioning
- No rollback capabilities

## Requirements

### 1. Migration Generation
- Create migration files from model changes
- SQL migration generation
- Migration versioning
- Rollback migration creation
- Data migration support

### 2. Migration Management
- Migration runner command
- Migration status tracking
- Rollback capabilities
- Migration dependencies
- Seed data management

### 3. Database Schema Management
- Schema comparison
- Index management
- Constraint handling
- Foreign key management
- Performance optimization

## Implementation Details

### Migration Structure
```go
type Migration struct {
    Version   string
    Name      string
    Up        string
    Down      string
    AppliedAt time.Time
}
```

### Generated Files
- Migration files (up/down SQL)
- Migration runner
- Schema comparison tools
- Seed data generators

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Migrations are generated from model changes
- [x] Migration runner works correctly
- [x] Rollback functionality is reliable
- [x] Schema changes are tracked
- [x] Seed data can be managed

## Implementation Completed
- ✅ Created migration templates (`internal/templates/migrations.go`)
- ✅ Migration file format with Up/Down SQL sections
- ✅ Migration runner with database version tracking
- ✅ Rollback functionality for migration reversal
- ✅ Makefile targets for migration commands

## Dependencies
- Task 01 (Database Providers) - Provider-specific migrations

## Effort Estimate
- 4-5 days of development
- 2 days for testing across databases
