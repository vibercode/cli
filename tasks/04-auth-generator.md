# Task 04: Authentication System Generator

## Status: âœ… Completed

## Overview
Generate comprehensive authentication and authorization systems with JWT, OAuth, and role-based access control.

## Current State
- No authentication system generation
- Basic project structure without auth

## Requirements

### 1. Authentication Methods
- JWT token authentication
- OAuth 2.0 integration (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Basic username/password auth
- API key authentication
- Session-based authentication

### 2. Authorization Features
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Permission-based access control
- Resource-based authorization
- Middleware for route protection
- Admin user management

### 3. Integration Features
- User registration and login endpoints
- Password reset functionality
- Email verification
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Social login integration

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create
- `internal/templates/auth.go` - Authentication templates
- `internal/models/auth.go` - Auth model structures
- `internal/generator/auth.go` - Auth generation logic

### Generated Components
- User model with authentication fields
- JWT middleware
- Auth handlers (login, register, logout)
- Auth service layer
- Role and permission models
- Protected route examples

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] JWT authentication is generated and functional
- [x] Role-based access control works
- [x] OAuth integration is available
- [x] Password security follows best practices
- [x] API documentation includes auth endpoints

## Dependencies
- Task 01 (Database Providers) - User storage
- Task 02 (Template System) - Enhanced templates needed

## Effort Estimate
- 4-5 days of development
- 2 days for testing and security review

## Testing Requirements
- Authentication flow testing
- Authorization middleware testing
- Security vulnerability testing
- Token validation testing
